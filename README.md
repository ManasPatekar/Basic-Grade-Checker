# 📌Basic-Grade-Checker


📝 Description:
The Basic Grade Checker is a simple web application that allows users to input their marks 
and determine their corresponding grade. It uses:
- HTML for structure
- CSS for styling
- JavaScript for logic

The program evaluates the input marks and displays the appropriate grade based on predefined conditions.

🔹 Features:
✅ User enters marks in an input field
✅ A button triggers the grade evaluation
✅ Uses if-else conditions to assign grades
✅ Displays the result on the webpage
✅ Provides an error message for invalid inputs

💻 Technologies Used:
- HTML → For the webpage structure
- CSS → For styling and adding a background image
- JavaScript → For processing user input and displaying results

🚀 How It Works:
1️⃣ The user enters their marks in the input field.
2️⃣ When the Check Grade button is clicked, the script evaluates the marks:
   - 80-100: "Excellent, you got A!"
   - 70-79: "Great, you got B!"
   - 60-69: "Good, you got C!"
   - 50-59: "Well, you got D!"
   - 0-49: "Hmm, you got F!"
3️⃣ The result is displayed on the webpage.
4️⃣ If the user enters invalid marks (e.g., negative numbers or above 100), an error message appears.

🎯 Example Outputs:
Marks Entered | Output
--------------|--------------------------------
85           | Excellent, you got A!
72           | Great, you got B!
65           | Good, you got C!
55           | Well, you got D!
30           | Hmm, you got F!
-10          | Error: Marks should be between 0 and 100!
110          | Error: Marks should be between 0 and 100!
